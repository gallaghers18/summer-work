# summer-work

This repository consists of a variety of random work I have done.

### ApiTest and PickFlixRecommender
Testing out the possibility of implementing an API for use as a recommender system to the PickFlix android app. It looks like this won't be followed up in the future as I plan on coding the recommender system myself so that I can actually fine tune it to work how we want it to.

### Dots and TestStuff
I was fascinated by beginning to explore machine learning and AI, so I created this quick javafx app using model-view-controller structure. As of right now it spawns dots that will move in random directions, becoming stuck and ceasing movement when they hit the edge of the screen or an obstacle. There is room in the future for adding more of a "brain" to it, such as sending dots out in waves after which it picks the best ones and reruns from the start while mimicking the successful dots steps for the first k waves.

Note: TestStuff was my attempt to do the same in Python first, but I later decided that I had better tools to use in Java.

### NatParks
I used this small project as a way of familiarizing myself with the Pandas package for Python. I went out and searched around until I found some good data about the locations and sizes of National Parks. I then cross referenced it with data about the sizes of each State to create a graph showing the percentage of each State that is occupied by National Parks. Conclusion: Alaska has a lot of National Park space!
